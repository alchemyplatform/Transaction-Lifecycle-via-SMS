## Tracking Transaction Life Cycles via SMS

While dApps on Ethereum have become incredibly complex, one of the largest pain points for Ethereum users is the lack of transparency and clarity surrounding a transaction's life cycle. Oftentimes, dApp users are left with uncertainty surrounding pending transactions, forcing them to constantly refresh block explorers or their wallet dashboards to check if their transactions have been confirmed/mined. 

For dApps, simple notifications that track transaction life cycles provide a valuable user experience that allows for higher customer engagement, helping to alleviate the stress involved in pending transactions as Ethereum's ever-increasing gas fees force users to set lower `maxPriorityFeePerGas` to save money and inadvertently increase wait times. While building reliable transaction trackers has traditionally been complicated and unreliable, Alchemy Notify and Alchemy's pending transaction WebSocket allows us to monitor and send sending real-time push notifications regarding tx life cycles.  

In this tutorial, weâ€™ll look at an example of how, with just a few lines of code, your dApp can integrate the power of Alchemy's Enhanced API suite, leveraging multiple Alchemy products to build a single feature to enhance user experience.

### How to upload code changes
Please make the next steps to upload your changes on Heroku.

Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install).
Run a terminal (or console) on your machine and type

```
heroku login
heroku git:clone -a <your Heroku application name>
cd <your Heroku application name>
git remote add origin https://github.com/aimylogic/python-webhook
git pull origin master
```

_You have to do these steps only once._

Once you are ready to upload your changes to Heroku, please type

```
git add .
git commit -am "some comments"
git push
```

Heroku will build and deploy your changes automatically.

## How to run this template locally in development mode
Run a terminal (or console) and jump into the folder with your copy of this template.
Type `python3 setup.py develop`, then `runwebhook`.

Webhook will be running at localhost `0.0.0.0:5000`. To let Aimylogic server send requests to your webhook, you have to share localhost url `0.0.0.0:5000` with, e.g., [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). Download ngrok and run it with:
* ngrok.exe http 5000 _(windows)_
* ./ngrok http 5000

Copy it and paste into the field named "Webhook for tests" in your bot's settings.
**All requests to your webhook will go to your local machine** while you test your bot scenario via a test widget on Aimylogic. This is very useful for rapid development and debugging purposes.

_Note that you don't have to restart the local server each time you change any source file. Flask will handle it for you serving the same public URL._

## How to use this template
`webhook.py` file contains all source code you need to change.
Here you can add/remove action handlers for your webhook (please read more about webhook actions on [Help Center](https://help.aimylogic.com/en/article/webhook-14yx2uz/)).

### How to add action handler
You can change action behaviour in _webhook_ function inside `webhook.py`. 

*webhook.py*
```python
def webhook(session):
    action = session['action']

    if action == 'event1':
        print('Received request from event1 action')
        session['variable'] = 'some value'

    return json.dumps(session)
```

Once the bot steps into the screen with enabled action _action1_, it calls your webhook and receives variable named _variable_ with value _"some value"_.

### How to return multiple variables
Just add variables in _session_ object

```python
def webhook(session):
    action = session['action']

    if action == 'event1':
        print('Received request from event1 action')
        session['variable1'] = 'value1'
        session['variable2'] = 'value2'

    return json.dumps(session)
```

This will provide _variable1_ and _variable2_ in Aimylogic scenario.

### How to handle multiple actions
You can add as many handlers as you need:


*webhook.py*
```python
def webhook(session):
    action = session['action']

    if action == 'event1':
        print('Received request from event1 action')
        session['variable1'] = "value1"

    elif action == 'event2':
        print('Received request from event2 action')
        session['variable2'] = "value2"

    return json.dumps(session), 200
```
